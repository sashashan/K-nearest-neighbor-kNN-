							K nearest neighbor algorithm

The data is available in the files “train 86 by 71.txt”, “tune 20 by 71.txt”, and “test 12 by 70.txt”.
The total number of samples is 118 (one line per paper). (A number of other papers with known
authorship of either Hamilton or Madison were added to the dataset, to provide extra data on
how the two authors made use of vocabulary.) The “train 86 by 71.txt” file is used to train the
model (K-NN). The “tune 20 by 71.txt” is used to tune the parameter K. The first entry in each
line contains the code number of the author: 1 for Hamilton and 2 for Madison. The remaining
entries contain 70 floating point numbers that correspond to the relative frequencies (number of
occurrences per 1000 words of the text) of the 70 function words, which are also available in the
data file as an array of strings. The “train 86 by 71.txt” has 86 samples and the tune 20 by 71.txt”
file has 20 samples.
The “test 12 by 70.txt” file is used to test the K-NN model. It has 12 samples, that is, 12
disputed papers. Each line in this file corresponds to a disputed paper.

This program predicts using kNN the authors of the disputed papers. 
The result found is that they were all written by Madison.
